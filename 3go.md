3GO is a platform to help people unfamiliar with digital security secure their online assets. 

What I have worked on this project.
Danny worked on 3GO with Fractionalist originally as a backend developer and quickly moved into a DevOps role where I managed the AWS infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines for the platform including backend, web and mobile deployments.
